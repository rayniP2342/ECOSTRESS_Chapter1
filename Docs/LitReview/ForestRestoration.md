**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.186

**Findings:**

- The region experienced drought conditions prior to restoration treatments, leading to significant decrease in NDVI
- Both NDVI and DNWI trends indicate the forest restoration treatments have contributed to increased total ecosystem moisture, potentially benefiting the water-stressed forest
- Treatments have either stabilized or reversed the declining NDVI trend
- Treatments improve the forests' resiliency to drought during the dry pre-Monsoon season when forests are most vulnerable to wildfires

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/rse2.210

**Findings:**

- Plant functional traits such as resprouting and desiccation tolerance play critical roles in shaping post0fire plant communities and forest water cycling
- This study highlights the utilitiy of the ECOSTRESS ET products for evaluation spatiotemporal trends in stand water use in arid, wildfire-affected landscapes
- Post fire ET can be high on high severity fire sites with prolific post-fire regeneration by anisohydric, sprouting shrubs
- Pinon scrub showed lower ET and canopy T than pine oak forest, but shrublands did not differ significantly
- Soil evaporation was highest in pinon scrub, then pine oak, then shrublands
-- Relationship is likely because as canopy cover increases, soil evaporation decreases
- Soil evaporation is important in pinon scrub sites that have high areas of exposed bare soil and rock
- Soil evaporation was a significant driver of post fire ET, especially from morning to midday
- Shrublands had higher ET values than other two vegetation types

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128242

**Findings:**

- Significant fire-induced ETa reductions were only distinguishable in basin-scale monthly datasets when > 73% of the basin burned
- The effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable
- Streamflow was modified in basins with little as 6% burned drainage areas, however shifts were only persistent beyond the fifth post-fire year when > 3/4 of the basin was burned
- Surplus water from ETa reduction was sufficiemt to account for boosted fire-induced streamflow
- Impacts to streamflow magnitude were better detected at a seasonal scale rather than an annual scale
- Some watershed saw increase in baseflow during wettest months, while other experienced an increase in baseflow during the dry months

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/hydrology8040169

**Findings:**

- Forest fires significantly increased flood peak and runoff volume, altered surface runoff, and reduced soil infiltration capacity

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.113906

**Findings:**

- This study used multivariance statistical analysis to classify evapotranspiration based on soil type and biomes in sugarcane, planted forest, and native forest areas, resulting in three distinct groups
- In areas with sugarcane and area with forest, the evapotraspiration was classified into three groups based on soil type and biome, demonstrating the influence of these factors on evapotranspiration
- Soil type did have a statistical impact on ET rates
-- Lithic leptosols had higher ET rates due to their high rock content and rapid drainage
- Soils with lithic contact within 50 cm of soil surface typically cannot retain water and absorb more heat
- Color of soils plays an important role in ET
-- Darker soils absorb more solar radiation and contribute to higher heat flow through the soil profile
- Wetter soils have slower heat flow because specific heat capacity is greater
- Soils with sandy texture becomes hotter in afternoon
- Coarse soils have less available water for evaporation because of rapid drainage

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/abfe8c

**Findings:**

- Streamflow, groundwater, and NDVI are strongly responsive to monsoonal rainfall
- Monsoonal storms are overtaking winter rain in terms of overall moisture contribution
- Water availability is stratified between wet, intermediate, and dry reach underlain by different geologic controls that affect the water table elevation
- Geologic controls are less important during strong monsoon years
