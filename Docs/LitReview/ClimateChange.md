### Tietjen et al., 2010

**Title:** *Effects of climate change on the coupled dynamics of water and vegetation in drylands. *

**Authors:** Tietjen, B., Jeltsch, F., Zehe, E., Classen, N., Groengroeft, A., Schiffers, K. and Oldeland, J. 

**Year:** 2010

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.70

**Findings:** 

*From Intro*
- Drylands form nearly 30% of global land surface (Stafford and Smith, 1996; Sivakumar et al 2005, Drenge, 1991)
- Tight coupling of water availability and veg dynamics (Noy-Meir, 1973)
- Climate change increase risk (Dore, 2005)
- Frequency of precip events decreases but number of extreme events increases (Easterling et al, 2000)
- High temps increase water stress thru evap (Hughes, 2003)
  
*From Main Body*
- Reduced MAP leads to decrease in soil moisture, mostly top soil layer suffers
- More extreme events impact lower soil layer
- Decreased precip and increased temps leads to reduced water availability
- Extreme events increases precip pulse depths (reduces evap from top soil layer, leads to plant water uptake)
--   Unless higher hydraulic K and steep slopes, then more runoff
- Understanding coupled dynamics of water and vegetation is important to assess climate change threats
- Different veg types respond differently to altered precip, temp, and CO2



### Goodrich et al., 2008

**Title:** *Event to multidecadal persistence in rainfall and runoff in southeast Arizona *

**Authors:** Goodrich D C, Unkrich C L, Keefer T O, Nichols M H, Stone J J, Levick L R and Scott R L

**Year:** 2008

**DOI:** 

**Findings:** 

- Limited water supplies in semi-arid regions (Thomas and Pool, 2006)
- Summer precip in southern AZ more variable
- Large interannual variability directly comparable to runoff variability
- Long term decrease in runoff from ephemeral tributaries may be primary cause of decreasing summer flows in San Pedro (due to changes in high-intensity rainfall)
