### Tietjen et al., 2010

**Citation:** *Tietjen, B., Jeltsch, F., Zehe, E., Classen, N., Groengroeft, A., Schiffers, K. and Oldeland, J. (2010), Effects of climate change on the coupled dynamics of water and vegetation in drylands. Ecohydrol., 3: 226-237.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.70

**Findings:** 

*From Intro*
- Drylands form nearly 30% of global land surface (Stafford and Smith, 1996; Sivakumar et al 2005, Drenge, 1991)
- Climate change increase risk (Dore, 2005)
- Frequency of precip events decreases but number of extreme events increases (Easterling et al, 2000)
- High temps increase water stress thru evap (Hughes, 2003)
  
*From Main Body*
- Reduced MAP leads to decrease in soil moisture, mostly top soil layer suffers
- More extreme events impact lower soil layer
- Decreased precip and increased temps leads to reduced water availability
- Extreme events increases precip pulse depths (reduces evap from top soil layer, leads to plant water uptake)
--   Unless higher hydraulic K and steep slopes, then more runoff
- Understanding coupled dynamics of water and vegetation is important to assess climate change threats
- Different veg types respond differently to altered precip, temp, and CO2

**DOI:** 

**Findings:** 

- Limited water supplies in semi-arid regions (Thomas and Pool, 2006)
- Summer precip in southern AZ more variable
- Large interannual variability directly comparable to runoff variability
- Long term decrease in runoff from ephemeral tributaries may be primary cause of decreasing summer flows in San Pedro (due to changes in high-intensity rainfall)

**DOI:** [Link to DOI or URL]

**Findings:**

- ENSO, PDO, and NAM are changes in climate that effect precipitation
- PDO can cause major long term droughts
- La Nina years - transpiration comprises 10-20% of total ET
- El Nino years - transpiration comprises 50% of total ET
- NAM contributes 60% of annual precip in southern AZ
- Interception - varies by plant type and precip amount, but typically returned to atmosphere via evaporation within a day
- Infiltration and runoff determine net input to soil
- Infiltration occurs over days to weeks
-- Roots cause hydaulic redistribution (some layers wetter than others) (Caldwell et al 1998, Ryel et al 2003)
- Soil water depleted by evaporation and plant uptake/transpiration
-- Soil evap occurs at < 15cm depth, but varies based on available energy (Ben-Asher et al, 1983)
- Soils with higher sand content have higher infiltration and evaporation rates (Dingman, 1994)
- Small precip events = less T and more E
- Additive effect of multiple events
- Snow events act like large rain events because larger proportion of water is partitioned to plant-available water

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- Runoff at the watershed scale is < 5% of annual water budget
- Runoff occurs within minutes of precip
-- Associated with high intensity (NAM) or high frequency (El Nino) years
- Seepage very small component of water budget

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6335

**Findings:**

- Increasing water demands in semi-arid regions result in critical status of groundwater
- Of 26 large dryland basins, recharge ranges from 0.2 to 35 mm/year (0.1 to 5% of precip)
- High variability of recharge rates from ephemeral streams, lakes, and fractured rock
- Climate variability at inter-annual timescales (ENSO) results in increased recharge in AZ x3


### Trenberth, 2011

**Citation:** *Trenberth K 2011 Changes in precipitation with climate change Clim. Res. 47 123–38.*

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- 7% change in water-capacity of atmosphere with 1 degree C change in temperature (C-C effect)
- Greenhouse effect increasing temp and surface evaporation (Yu and Weller, 2007)
- C-C effect increases moisture over the oceans and mid latitude regions, but little change to total precip
-- Leads to more intense but less frequent rains
- Wet areas get wetter, dry areas get drier
- Change from snow to rain (especially at beginning and end of cold season)
-- Snowpack melts faster (Mote, 2003)
-- Less soil moisture in the summer
-- Great risk of drought, heat waves, and wild fires
- Net radiation affected by albedo (ice, clouds, aerosols)
-- Affect solar radiation at surface and energy available for sensible and latent heat fluxes
- Warmer climate increases risk of drought and floods

**DOI:**

**Findings**

- Tight coupling of water availability and veg dynamics
- Rainfall activates biological processes until water is used up, then the system returns to an inactive steady state
- Water is primary constraint on biological activity
- Rapid evaporation from soil constrains plant water uptake
- Plants have evolved strategies to optimize water use and minimize transpiration
- The "pulse - reserve" paradigm results in the episodic nature of ET in deserts
- Coupling between energy inputs and water availability
-- High temps can increase evaporative rates, intensify water stress, and influence ET patterns
- Energy input is a key driver of water loss, especially after rainfall events
- Water is temporarily available but quickly depleted
- Summer rainfall is less effective because higher temps and greater solar radiation cause water to evaporate before it can benefit plants
- Winter rains are more effective due to lower temps allowing for infiltration and storage
- Vegetation creates micro climates
- Plants adapt by storing water reserves underground which is critical for maintaining ecosystem stability
