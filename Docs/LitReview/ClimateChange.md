### Tietjen et al., 2010

**Title:** *Effects of climate change on the coupled dynamics of water and vegetation in drylands. *

**Authors:** Tietjen, B., Jeltsch, F., Zehe, E., Classen, N., Groengroeft, A., Schiffers, K. and Oldeland, J. 

**Year:** 2010

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.70

**Findings:** 

*From Intro*
- Drylands form nearly 30% of global land surface (Stafford and Smith, 1996; Sivakumar et al 2005, Drenge, 1991)
- Tight coupling of water availability and veg dynamics (Noy-Meir, 1973)
- Climate change increase risk (Dore, 2005)
- Frequency of precip events decreases but number of extreme events increases (Easterling et al, 2000)
- High temps increase water stress thru evap (Hughes, 2003)
  
*From Main Body*
- Reduced MAP leads to decrease in soil moisture, mostly top soil layer suffers
- More extreme events impact lower soil layer
- Decreased precip and increased temps leads to reduced water availability
- Extreme events increases precip pulse depths (reduces evap from top soil layer, leads to plant water uptake)
--   Unless higher hydraulic K and steep slopes, then more runoff
- Understanding coupled dynamics of water and vegetation is important to assess climate change threats
- Different veg types respond differently to altered precip, temp, and CO2



### Goodrich et al., 2008

**Title:** *Event to multidecadal persistence in rainfall and runoff in southeast Arizona *

**Authors:** Goodrich D C, Unkrich C L, Keefer T O, Nichols M H, Stone J J, Levick L R and Scott R L

**Year:** 2008

**DOI:** 

**Findings:** 

- Limited water supplies in semi-arid regions (Thomas and Pool, 2006)
- Summer precip in southern AZ more variable
- Large interannual variability directly comparable to runoff variability
- Long term decrease in runoff from ephemeral tributaries may be primary cause of decreasing summer flows in San Pedro (due to changes in high-intensity rainfall)



### Loik et al., 2004

**Title:** *A multi-scale perspective of water pulses in dryland ecosystems: climatology and ecohydrology of the western USA *

**Authors:** Loik M E, Breshears D D, Lauenroth WK and Belnap J 

**Year:** 2004

**DOI:** [Link to DOI or URL]

**Findings:**

- ENSO, PDO, and NAM are changes in climate that effect precipitation
- PDO can cause major long term droughts
- La Nina years - transpiration comprises 10-20% of total ET
- El Nino years - transpiration comprises 50% of total ET
- NAM contributes 60% of annual precip in southern AZ
- Interception - varies by plant type and precip amount, but typically returned to atmosphere via evaporation within a day
- Infiltration and runoff determine net input to soil
- Infiltration occurs over days to weeks
-- Roots cause hydaulic redistribution (some layers wetter than others) (Caldwell et al 1998, Ryel et al 2003)
- Soil water depleted by evaporation and plant uptake/transpiration
-- Soil evap occurs at < 15cm depth, but varies based on available energy (Ben-Asher et al, 1983)
- Soils with higher sand content have higher infiltration and evaporation rates (Dingman, 1994)
- Small precip events = less T and more E
- Additive effect of multiple events
- Snow events act like large rain events because larger proportion of water is partitioned to plant-available water


### Wilcox et al., 2003

**Title:** *Water balance on rangelands *

**Authors:** Wilcox BP, Breshears DD, Seyfried M 

**Year:** 2003

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- Runoff at the watershed scale is < 5% of annual water budget
- Runoff occurs within minutes of precip
-- Associated with high intensity (NAM) or high frequency (El Nino) years
- Seepage very small component of water budget



### Scanlon et al., 2006

**Title:** *Global synthesis of groundwater recharge in semiarid and arid regions.*

**Authors:** Scanlon, B.R., Keese, K.E., Flint, A.L., Flint, L.E., Gaye, C.B., Edmunds, W.M. and Simmers, I. 

**Year:** 2006

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.6335

**Findings:**

- Increasing water demands in semi-arid regions result in critical status of groundwater
- Of 26 large dryland basins, recharge ranges from 0.2 to 35 mm/year (0.1 to 5% of precip)
- High variability of recharge rates from ephemeral streams, lakes, and fractured rock
- Climate variability at inter-annual timescales (ENSO) results in increased recharge in AZ x3


### Trenberth, 2011

**Title:** *Changes in precipitation with climate change*

**Authors:** Trenberth, K.

**Year:** 2011

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- 7% change in water-capacity of atmosphere with 1 degree C change in temperature (C-C effect)
- Greenhouse effect increasing temp and surface evaporation (Yu and Weller, 2007)
- C-C effect increases moisture over the oceans and mid latitude regions, but little change to total precip
-- Leads to more intense but less frequent rains
- Wet areas get wetter, dry areas get drier
- Change from snow to rain (especially at beginning and end of cold season)
-- Snowpack melts faster (Mote, 2003)
-- Less soil moisture in the summer
-- Great risk of drought, heat waves, and wild fires
- Net radiation affected by albedo (ice, clouds, aerosols)
-- Affect solar radiation at surface and energy available for sensible and latent heat fluxes
- Warmer climate increases risk of drought and floods
