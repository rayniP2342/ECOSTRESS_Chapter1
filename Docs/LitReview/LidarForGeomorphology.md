**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.01.017 

**Findings:**

- Check dams are effective restoration structures across different time scales
- Structures promote aggradation
- Structures have short and long term benefits
- Old structures stabilized the channel due to sediment and vegetation establishment and the stream reached relative equilibrium
- Streams with new structures are still actively evolving by decreasing flow velocity (16%) and increasing depth of water (12%)
- TLS is an effective method for quantifying geomorphic changes

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.007

**Findings:**

- TLS can repeatedly capture gully morphology
- TLS provides a tool for monitoring temporal changes in gully topography
- TLS effectively detected both erosional and depositional processes within the gully
- TLS can inform effective management practices
- Variable propogation error detected twice the amount of erosion than a constant propogation error (Ucrit)
- TLS derived DEMs can be accurately registered over time
- Careful consideration of sensor specifications and sampling configurations are needed to ensure repeatable and accurate TLS derived DEMs

**Additional Notes:**

- TLS are well suited to mapping fine scale fluvial and gully environments (Bremer and Sass, 2012; Kociuba et al., 2014)
- TLS can capture large areas (e.g. Hofle et al., 2013)
- Understanding sources of error for TLS is important for monitoring subtle changes in gully morphology because error propogate between dates and increase uncertainty (Brasington et al., 2003)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.4408/IJEGE.2011-01.S-03

**Findings:**

- LiDAR provides detailed topographic data, enabling precise mapping of river channels, floodplains, and surrounding landscapes
- LiDAR provides detailed Digital Terrain Models (DTMs) with high vertical and horizontal accuracy, enabling precise mapping of riverine landscapes
- LiDAR's capability to filter out vegetation and man-made structures from raw data allows for the creation of bare-earth DTMs, essential for accurate hydrological and geomorphological analyses
- The accuracy of LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) improves hydraulic models, leading to better flood risk assessments and management strategies
- LiDAR data facilitates the identification of geomorphic features such as terraces, banks, and bedforms, aiding in understanding river dynamics and sediment transport processes
- The technology assists in distinguishing between ground surfaces and vegetation, allowing for the analysis of riparian zones and their ecological health
- LiDAR surveys cover large areas more efficiently and cost-effectively compared to traditional ground-based surveys, reducing the time and resources required for data collection

**DOI:** doi:10.3390/rs5126382

**Additional Notes:**

- High quality topographic and bathymetric data is required to study fluvial processes and river dynamics (Best, 2005)
- Accuracy of DEMs is critical for fluvial geomorphological mapping and hydrodynamic modeling (Alho et al, 2009; Cobby et al, 2001; Bates, 2004)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2019.02.020

**Findings:**
- The magnitude of geomorphic change is dampened by coarser resolution DTM
- Coarser resolution analysis attributes more change to dominant geomorphoc processes
- Sediment imbalance magnitudes are exaggerated at coarser resolutions
- Both TLS and SfM produced comparable estimates for site scale sediment budgets
- Finest obtainable resolution is not always necessary for accurately quantifying geomorphic change, but the choice of resolution should be optimized to capture the spatial scale of the processes driving landscape change
- In landscapes near sediment equilibrium finer resolutions should be used to avoid amplifying sediment imbalances and misinterpreting site trends
