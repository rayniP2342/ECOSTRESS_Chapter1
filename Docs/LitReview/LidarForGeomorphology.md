**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.01.017 

**Findings:**

- Check dams are effective restoration structures across different time scales
- Structures promote aggradation
- Structures have short and long term benefits
- Old structures stabilized the channel due to sediment and vegetation establishment and the stream reached relative equilibrium
- Streams with new structures are still actively evolving by decreasing flow velocity (16%) and increasing depth of water (12%)
- TLS is an effective method for quantifying geomorphic changes

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.catena.2007.11.001

**Findings:**

- This paper analyses the capability of airborne LiDAR-derived data in the recognition of channel-bed morphology
- Lidar based DEM were capable of recognizing river morphology in mountain rivers
- Potential to distinguish riffle-pool and step-pool morphology
- Lidar can improve river managment practices by offering detailed insight to channel morphology which is important for sediment transport and restoration studies

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2016.03.007

**Findings:**

- TLS can repeatedly capture gully morphology
- TLS provides a tool for monitoring temporal changes in gully topography
- TLS effectively detected both erosional and depositional processes within the gully
- TLS can inform effective management practices
