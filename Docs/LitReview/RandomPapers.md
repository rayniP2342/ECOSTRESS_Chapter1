- Ephemeral stream are more sensitive to climatic and anthropogrenic disturbances than perennial streams especially in semiaird regions
- Due to high sediment supply from hillslopes during infrequent high magnitude storms
- Also due to lack of baseflow
- Lack of stable vegetation increases vulnerability to erosion and sediment transport
