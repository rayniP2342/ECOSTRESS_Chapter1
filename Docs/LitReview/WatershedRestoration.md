**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecohyd.2015.12.001

**Findings:**

- This study involved a paired watershed study and model analysis (SWAT and MODFLOW)
- The model overestimated discharge in the treated watershed at the beginning of monsoon due to increased initial demands of the watershed
- The model underestimated discharge at end of monsoon because it was not calibrated to account for increased soil-water storage behind dams nor the extended baseflow over time
- The treated watershed increased runoff volume of 28% due to lateral flow and baseflow supported by soil water storage
- Increased residence time increases recharge to the aquifer

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geomorph.2017.01.017 

**Findings:**

- Check dams are effective restoration structures across different time scales
- Old structures stabilized the channel due to sediment and vegetation establishment and the stream reached relative equilibrium
- Streams with new structures are still actively evolving by decreasing flow velocity (16%) and increasing depth of water (12%)

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1002/rra.2895

**Findings:**

- The treated watershed had lower runoff response to precipitation compared to the untreated watershed (especially peak flow
- The controlled watershed had a flashier response
- Flow volumes in the treated watershed were higher despite peak flow being damped
- Sediment behind the dams increased storage capacity for groundwater/soil water, leading to higher water tables over time and increasing runoff from rejected recharge
- Check dams are useful tools for reducing flow velocities and increasing baseflow in arid lands

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.3390/w11020381

**Findings:**

- MODFLOW simulation predicted infiltration increased 10% at each gabion structure
- The stream need 450 gabions to increase aquifer recharge
- SWAT predicted structures would decrease surface runoff and increase shallow and deep aquifer recharge and total water yield in stream
- It is important to accurately represent lateral flow for both models
- As lateral flow decreases, surface runoff and ET increases
- Gabion increase infiltration by increasing ponding time, NOT by changing hydraulic conductivity
- Slow and retain flows, increase vegetation shading/cooling, increase ponding duration, increase groundwater storage potential
- Need measurements of porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and thermal propoerties of sediments to reduce uncertainties

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/su132011268

**Findings:**

- Treatement areas had depressed air temp of 3 degrees C for 32 hours following rain event compared to the control
- Treatement areas had increased relative humidity by 40% compared to control
- Model results predicted cumulative infiltration inrease of 15% and muted peak flow events
- Rock dams increase climate resiliency in semi-urban environments

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1097/SS.0000000000000160

**Findings:**

- Check dams did not significantly affect runoff from major storm events but 50% of measured sediment yield was retained by structures (Polyakov et al, 2014)
- Rock dams changed rainfall runoff ratio, but change is not persistent after dams fill to capacity
- One watershed returned to pre-dam conditions after 2 years
- The other watershed showed continual impact to rainfall-runoff ratio but only during small storm events
- 80% of structures reached sediment capacity within 7 years
- Vegetation plays a critical role in site stabilization by increasing surface roughness and reduced velocity
- Watershed outlet measurements do not accurately characterize the influences of check dams on the watershed response
- Maintenance of dams is critical for continued effects

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2021.679189

**Findings:**

- Rock dams increase water availability by reducing peak runoff and increasing baseflow
- Prolonged stream flows, increased aquifer recharge, and prolonged inundation
- Sediment behind rock dams increases water storage capacity and baseflow
- Reduced erosion and increased vegetation cover leads to ecologically diverse stream channels
- Reduced vegetation's dependency on precipitation as a water source
- OTher positive impacts include water quality, carbon sequestration, regulation of microclimates, wildfire resiliency, and drought resiliency
