**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-024-01953-z

**Findings:**

- Fraction of precip that becomes recharge correlates with climatic aridity
- Recharge fraction often approaches 0 in very arid regions
- Little to no diffuse recharge via precip
- Recharge fraction is sensitive to climate aridity changes
- Changes to precip and ET have a large effect on recharge rates in regions where ET is slightly higher that P
- Change in precip leads to larger percent change in recharge
- In arid regions changes in precip have smaller effects on recharge rates (recharge fraction is already low(
- Effects of future precip changes larger than future ET changes
- Southwest US shows a drying trend with lower recharge rates
- Precip indiced recharge changes are 2.2 times higher than precip change itself

**Additional Notes:**

- Modelled recharge accumulates erros of other water budget components (Reinecke et al, 2021; West et al 2023)
- Small scale models are more accurate but cannot be upscaled


## Pool, 2005

**Citation:** *Pool, D.R., 2005. Variations in climate and ephemeral channel recharge in southeastern Arizona, United States. Water resources research, 41(11)*

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- Winter recharge dominates in southwest AZ
- Summer monsoons are few and far between, very localized, may not produce runoff due to ET
- GW recharge depends on ENSO because winter precip is the primary recharge source
- Interannual and long-term variation in recharge
- Increased rates of recharge are associated with increased frequency of El Nino conditions
- Infiltration varies seasonally (will impact overall recharge rates)
- Streamflow in AZ is dependent on El Nino/La Nina events
- El Nino corresponds to above normal winter/spring precip and recharge
- Neutral ENSO conditions results in extreme precip and streamflow
- La Nina corresponds to below average winter/spring precip and streamflow

**Additional Notes:**

- Recharge from ephemeral stream is the most important in southwest US (Phillips et al 2004)
- Mountain blocks in southwest AZ accept little recharge (Anderson et al, 1992)
- Wet summers follow dry winters (Higgins et al, 1998)

**DOI:** 

**Findings:** 

- Surface water storage (reservoirs) made worse by reductions in snow storage with climate change

**Additional Notes:**

- Climate change is going to increase the intensity of climate extremes (Tebaldi et al, 2006)
- In semiarid regions extraction rates exceed natural recharge rates (konikow, 2013)
- Alluvial aquifers in AZ heavily depleted in last century

**DOI:** 

**Findings:** 

- Groundwater withdrawls began in late 1800s
- Withdrawls greatly exceed recharge
- Water use patterns and practices changed after 1980 due to subsidence and water table decline (still declining but less so)
- Arizona alluvial basins are single largest contributor to total depletion of Western States alluvial basins (57% of total alluvial basin depletion)
- Recharge is 1-3% of precip in northeast AZ aquifer
- Large declines in Black Mesa aquifer since 1970s

**Findings:**

- Aquifer recharge is generally mountain block and mountain front
- Some focused stream flow recharge in washes
- Pumping led to water level declines of 100 m or more by 1970s
- AMA population have increased since GWA and continue to increase
- Land use shift from agricultural to urban
- Declines in precip have long term and immediate impact on GW levels
- Falling water table trends before GWA

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1038/nclimate1744

**Findings:**

- Climate change influences groundwater systems
- Recharge in arid and semi-arid regions in less than 5 mm/yr
- Current recharge rates responsible for small fraction of total GW storage
- Recharge in semi-arid environments is restricted to extreme rainfall
- Land use change exerts a stronger influences on hydrology than climate change
- Irrigration has depleted GW storage in several semi-arid environments
- GW is important to water security especially in rural communities
- Sustainability of GW requires aquifer management (Gleeson et al, 2011)
