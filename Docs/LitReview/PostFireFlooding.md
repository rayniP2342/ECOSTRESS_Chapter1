## Reduced Infiltration

### Beatty et al., 2013

**Citation:** *Beatty, S.M. and Smith, J.E., 2013. Dynamic soil water repellency and infiltration in post-wildfire soils. Geoderma, 192, pp.160-172.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.08.012

**Findings:** 

- Post wildfire soils exhibit increased water repellency, leading to reduced infiltration rates
- Repellency is influenced by soil moisture content and temperature
- Soils that are uniformly hydrophobic experienced longer delays in infiltration

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13583

**Findings:**

- Soil water content generally lower in unburned soils compared to burned soils, especially immediately after fires
- Negative correlation between soil water content and water repellency  (increased repellency reduced soil moisture retention)
- Surface water repellency decreased relative infiltration rates
- Depth and persistence of soil water repellency layers post-wildfire are influenced by fire severity and soil characteristics

**DOI:** https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/esp.4370

**Findings:**

- Strong correlation between aridity and post-wildfire runoff ratios
- Soil water repellency was more pronounced at drier sites (reduced infiltration and increases runoff)
- Drier regions more susceptible to increased surface runoff after wildfires


## Streamflow Response

### Collar et al., 2022

**Citation:** *Collar, N. M., Saxe, S., Ebel, B. A., Boden, K. S., Rust, A. J., & Hogue, T. S. (2022). Linking fire-induced evapotranspiration shifts to streamflow magnitude and timing in the western United States. Journal of Hydrology, 612.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128242

**Findings:**

- Significant fire-induced ETa reductions were only distinguishable in basin-scale monthly datasets when > 73% of the basin burned
- The effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable
- Streamflow was modified in basins with little as 6% burned drainage areas, however shifts were only persistent beyond the fifth post-fire year when > 3/4 of the basin was burned
- Surplus water from ETa reduction was sufficient to account for boosted fire-induced streamflow
- Impacts to streamflow magnitude were better detected at a seasonal scale rather than an annual scale
- Some watershed saw increase in baseflow during wettest months, while other experienced an increase in baseflow during the dry months

**DOI:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11617652faeb7f405e724083de1cfb2082618ad3

**Findings:**

- Wildfires can significantly impact streamflow by altering infiltration, ET, snowmelt, and hillslope runoff pathways
- Unburned areas within watershed can mitigate increased streamflow
- Semi-arid climates experienced more pronounced increase in peak flows and annual water yields compared to highland regions (due to differences in climate, vegetation, and soil characteristics)
- Fire-induced changes in hydraulic connectivity play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of streamflow responses
- Increased connectivity can lead to more rapid and effecient delivery of water to streams, amplifying peak flows
- Post fire conditions lead to soil surface sealing and water repellency (reduce infiltration, enhance runoff)

**Citation:** *Moussoulis, E., Mallinis, G., Koutsias, N. and Zacharias, I., 2015. Modelling surface runoff to evaluate the effects of wildfires in multiple semi‐arid, shrubland‐dominated catchments. Hydrological Processes, 29(20), pp.4427-4441.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.10509

**Findings:**

- Wildfires significantly increase surface runoff in burned catchments
- Increase in surface runoff attributed to loss of vegetation and changes in soil properties which reduce infiltration and enhance runoff
- Extent of runoff increase varied among catchements
- Catchments with denser pre-fire vegetation and steeper slopes exhibit more pronounced increase in runoff post-fire
- Heightened runoff potential persisten for several years post-fire
- Increase in runoff may lead to decrease in groundwater recharge and downstream flooding

**DOI:** 

**Findings:**

- Post wildfire condition significantly elevated flood risks in urban areas, necessitating proactive planning and infrustructure improvements
- Existing stormwater systems were insufficient to handle increased runoff and sediment transport following wildfires
- Proactive measures are essential to mitigate heightened flood risks following wildfires

## ET Response

**Citation:** *Poon, P.K. and Kinoshita, A.M., 2018. Spatial and temporal evapotranspiration trends after wildfire in semi-arid landscapes. Journal of hydrology, 559, pp.71-83.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.02.023

**Findings:**

- Post fire annual ET decreased and varies by burn severity
- ET rates gradually increased over decade following wildfire
- Areas with higher burn severity exhibited slower ET recovery
