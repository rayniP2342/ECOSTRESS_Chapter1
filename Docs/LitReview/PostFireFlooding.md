## Reduced Infiltration

### Beatty et al., 2013

**Citation:** *Beatty, S.M. and Smith, J.E., 2013. Dynamic soil water repellency and infiltration in post-wildfire soils. Geoderma, 192, pp.160-172.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2012.08.012

**Findings:** 

- Post wildfire soils exhibit increased water repellency, leading to reduced infiltration rates
- Repellency is influenced by soil moisture content and temperature
- Soils that are uniformly hydrophobic experienced longer delays in infiltration


### Chen et al, 2020

**Citation:** *Chen, J., McGuire, K.J. and Stewart, R.D., 2020. Effect of soil water‐repellent layer depth on post‐wildfire hydrological processes. Hydrological Processes, 34(2), pp.270-283.*

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.13583

**Findings:**

- Soil water content generally lower in unburned soils compared to burned soils, especially immediately after fires
- Negative correlation between soil water content and water repellency  (increased repellency reduced soil moisture retention)
- Surface water repellency decreased relative infiltration rates
- Depth and persistence of soil water repellency layers post-wildfire are influenced by fire severity and soil characteristics

**DOI:** https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/esp.4370

**Findings:**

- Strong correlation between aridity and post-wildfire runoff ratios
- Soil water repellency was more pronounced at drier sites (reduced infiltration and increases runoff)
- Drier regions more susceptible to increased surface runoff after wildfires




## Streamflow Response

### Collar et al., 2022

**Citation:** *Collar, N. M., Saxe, S., Ebel, B. A., Boden, K. S., Rust, A. J., & Hogue, T. S. (2022). Linking fire-induced evapotranspiration shifts to streamflow magnitude and timing in the western United States. Journal of Hydrology, 612.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2022.128242

**Findings:**

- Significant fire-induced ETa reductions were only distinguishable in basin-scale monthly datasets when > 73% of the basin burned
- The effect of wildfire disturbance on streamflow magnitude was seasonably variable
- Streamflow was modified in basins with little as 6% burned drainage areas, however shifts were only persistent beyond the fifth post-fire year when > 3/4 of the basin was burned
- Surplus water from ETa reduction was sufficient to account for boosted fire-induced streamflow
- Impacts to streamflow magnitude were better detected at a seasonal scale rather than an annual scale
- Some watershed saw increase in baseflow during wettest months, while other experienced an increase in baseflow during the dry months

**Citation:** *D. Hallema, G. Sun, K. Bladon, S. Norman, P. Caldwell, Yongqiang Liu, & S. McNulty. (2017). Regional patterns of postwildfire streamflow response in the Western United States: The importance of scale‐specific connectivity. In Hydrological Processes.*

**DOI:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/11617652faeb7f405e724083de1cfb2082618ad3

**Findings:**

- Wildfires can significantly impact streamflow by altering infiltration, ET, snowmelt, and hillslope runoff pathways
- Unburned areas within watershed can mitigate increased streamflow
- Semi-arid climates experienced more pronounced increase in peak flows and annual water yields compared to highland regions (due to differences in climate, vegetation, and soil characteristics)
- Fire-induced changes in hydraulic connectivity play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of streamflow responses
- Increased connectivity can lead to more rapid and effecient delivery of water to streams, amplifying peak flows
- Post fire conditions lead to soil surface sealing and water repellency (reduce infiltration, enhance runoff)

**Citation:** *Moussoulis, E., Mallinis, G., Koutsias, N. and Zacharias, I., 2015. Modelling surface runoff to evaluate the effects of wildfires in multiple semi‐arid, shrubland‐dominated catchments. Hydrological Processes, 29(20), pp.4427-4441.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/hyp.10509

**Findings:**

- Wildfires significantly increase surface runoff in burned catchments
- Increase in surface runoff attributed to loss of vegetation and changes in soil properties which reduce infiltration and enhance runoff
- Extent of runoff increase varied among catchements
- Catchments with denser pre-fire vegetation and steeper slopes exhibit more pronounced increase in runoff post-fire
- Heightened runoff potential persisten for several years post-fire
- Increase in runoff may lead to decrease in groundwater recharge and downstream flooding

**DOI:** 

**Findings:**

- Post wildfire condition significantly elevated flood risks in urban areas, necessitating proactive planning and infrustructure improvements
- Existing stormwater systems were insufficient to handle increased runoff and sediment transport following wildfires
- Proactive measures are essential to mitigate heightened flood risks following wildfires




## ET Response

**Citation:** *Poon, P.K. and Kinoshita, A.M., 2018. Spatial and temporal evapotranspiration trends after wildfire in semi-arid landscapes. Journal of hydrology, 559, pp.71-83.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhydrol.2018.02.023

**Findings:**

- Post fire annual ET decreased and varies by burn severity
- ET rates gradually increased over decade following wildfire
- Areas with higher burn severity exhibited slower ET recovery



## Groundwater Recharge Response


## Sediment Response

### Schenk et al., 2025

**Citation:** *Schenk, E. R., Wood, A., Haden, A., Baca, G., Fleishman, J., and Loverich, J.: Post-wildfire sediment source and transport modeling, empirical observations, and applied mitigation: an Arizona, USA, case study, Nat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 727–745, 2025*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-25-727-2025

**Findings:**

- Museum fire caused significant floods and sedimentation that entered the city (Porter et al, 2021, Schenk et al, 2023, Sankey et al, 2024)
- Many channel are gullyied post-wildfire, function as sediment source rather than sink
- Majority of sediment transported to city was during the first flood event
- Model predicted higher hillslope erosion in steeper, burned areas of watershed
- High hillslope erosion predicted
- Exacerbates headcutting, fan degradation, channel migration, and bank erosion
- Alluvial fans did not function well to aggradte and attenuate sediment
- Flooding events demonstrated high sediment supply from burned area
- Hillslope gullying is most prevalent form of erosion in Arizona post0wildfire environments
- Drastic increases in channel and hillslope sedimen yields post-wildfire
- Drought condition contribute to degredation of channel
- Continued erosion and rilling hinder seed establishment

**Additional Notes:**

- Potential for damamging devris flow sand sediment sourcing, transport, and aggredation (Moody et al, 2013; Smith et al 2011)
- Sediment hazard is most damaging due to physical impacts (Moody et al, 2013, Neary et al 2013, Shakesby, 2011)
- Wildfires enhance runoff by order of magnitue of 1-2 (Leao and Tecle, 2005; Quisenberry 2009)


### Sankey et al., 2024

**Citation:** *Sankey, T. T., Tango, L., Tatum, J., and Sankey, J. B.: Forest fire, thinning, and flood in wildland-urban interface: UAV and lidar-based estimate of natural disaster impacts, Landscape Ecol., 39, 58, https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-024-01811-5, 2024*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/s10980-024-01811-5

**Findings:** 

- Bare ground tripled over 4 year period
- Erosion and deposition occurred in the channel but topographic changes were net depositional
- Extreme rainfall events carried sediment downstream into City of Flagstaff and caused geomorhpic changes
- Thinning helped reduce future catastrophic fire risk
- Severe damamges caused by sediment-laden floodings
- Impacts of floods can overwhelm current infrustructure 

**Additional Notes:** 

- WUI are growing into adjacent forested areas putting more people and forests at risk of fire (Radeloff et al 2018)
- Size and frequency of fires are increasing globally due to climate change (Hawbbaker and Zhu 2012)
