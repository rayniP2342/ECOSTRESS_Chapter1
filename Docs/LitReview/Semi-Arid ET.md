### Wilcox et al., 2006

**Citation:** *Wilcox BP, Dowhower, S., Teague, R., Thurow, T. 2006. Long-term water balance in semiarid shrubland*

**DOI:** [Link to DOI or URL]

**Findings:**

- Little surface runoff is ever generated in shrublands, even during large storms
- Surface runoff approaches 30% of precipitation in mesquite lands
- ET in rangelands ranges from 0 to 5 mm/day during dry periods
- ET of mesquite ranges depending on water availability
-- Roots can extract water from over 120 cm
- Almost all water exits via ET - 99%
- Very little water runs off or percolates deeper than 1 m
- Little potential for increasing water supply by reducing shrub cover

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.157

**Findings:**

- Soil moisture at the surface fluctuates more than at deeper depths and peaked after precip events
- Monsoons increase moisture at deeper profile
- Increased ET rates follow precip events
- Lag of peak T after precip events occurs for creosote, acacia, and shrubs
-- Relationship between precip and T not clear
-- Lagged response coincides with moisture reaching deeper in soil profile
- Strongest correlation between ET and soil moisture at shallow depths (37.5 cm and 15 cm)
- Strongest correlation between evaporation and soil moisture at 2.4 cm depth
- Correlation of ET to shallow soil layers typical of semi-arid ecosystems
-- High evaporative demand, poor infiltration (Scott et al, 2000)
- Precip rarely percolates below 10 cm in the summer (in this region), roots below this depth are not wetted
- Near zero ET prior to summer rains (also Kurc and Small, 2004; Scott et al, 2006)
- When plants dormant, E will dominate ET
- T response not seen until 3 weeks following start of summer rainfall
- Peak T rates rarely sustain more than a day (almost always in a water limited state)
- Years with more precip events later in summer have higher T/ET ratio
- Amount of bare space and percent cover will affect T/ET ratio
- Rapid evaporation of surface soil layers between small precip events
- More intense precip events are favorable because water percolates to rooting depths

**Citation:** *Scott RL. 2010. Using watershed water balance to evaluate the accuracy of eddy covariance evaporation measurements for three semi arid ecosystems. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 150: 219–225.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.11.002

**Findings:**

- Precip and ET dominate water balance at every site
- Fore summer drought - cumulative evaporation usually exceeds precip and depletes soil moisture
- Summer monsoons - evaporation lags behind precip, increasing soil moisture
- Fall - evaporation declines as veg down-regulates and soil evaporation declines in response to decreasing soil moisture
- A savanna E nearly equals P in most years
- At shrubland E nearly equals P in driest years, and less than P in years with runoff
- At grasslands E less than P - R - SM
- Majority of evaporation occurs during daytime and when RN - G is high
- Evaporation underestimated by 17-27%
