**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- ET accounts for 95% of water budget/precip
- Bimodal patterns with peaks occuring after spring snowmelt and late summer monsoons (periods that coincide with highs soil moisture)
- Radiative energy inputs are highest in June/July but soil moisture is low, thus ET is low
- Soil moisture is highest in early May but daytime transpiration is limited due to freezing nighttime temps
- ET peaks in late spring and late summer, and is lowest in June and July
- The A horizon soil moisture is highly responsive to monsoon events but is quickly reduced to due to ET
-- There is less response at deeper layers
-- Soil moisture is not transported fast enough to meet evaporative demand
- ET and soil moisture are essential to understanding the surface hydrology of systems dominated by ET
- The quantity of snowpack causes ET to vary
- Shallow soil moisture is an important control on ET
- ET is moisture limited
- No evidence of atmosphere controlled rates

**Citation:** *Cavanaugh, M., Kurc, S., Scott, R., 2011. Evapotranspiration partitioning in semiarid shrubland ecosystems: a two-site evaluation of soil moisture control on transpiration. In Ecohydrology.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.157

**Findings:**

- Soil moisture at the surface fluctuates more than at deeper depths and peaked after precip events
- Monsoons increase moisture at deeper profile
- Increased ET rates follow precip events
- Lag of peak T after precip events occurs for creosote, acacia, and shrubs
-- Relationship between precip and T not clear
-- Lagged response coincides with moisture reaching deeper in soil profile
- Strongest correlation between ET and soil moisture at shallow depths (37.5 cm and 15 cm)
- Strongest correlation between evaporation and soil moisture at 2.4 cm depth
- Correlation of ET to shallow soil layers typical of semi-arid ecosystems
-- High evaporative demand, poor infiltration (Scott et al, 2000)
- Precip rarely percolates below 10 cm in the summer (in this region), roots below this depth are not wetted
- When plants dormant, E will dominate ET
- T response not seen until 3 weeks following start of summer rainfall
- Peak T rates rarely sustain more than a day (almost always in a water limited state)
- Years with more precip events later in summer have higher T/ET ratio
- Amount of bare space and percent cover will affect T/ET ratio
- Rapid evaporation of surface soil layers between small precip events
- More intense precip events are favorable because water percolates to rooting depths

**Additional Notes:**

- Near zero ET prior to summer rains (also Kurc and Small, 2004; Scott et al, 2006)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13122414

**Findings:**
- This study evaluates 5 global ET products by comparing them with reconstructed ET based on ground and GRACE observations for 592 CONUS watersheds
- This study also identifies advantages/disadvantages of the 5 ET algorithms 
- Five models = P-LSH, PML, MODIS, MTE, and GLEAM (MTE best, MODSI worst)
- All R-values were equal to or higher than 0.85
- Combination of machine learning and physical process algorithms improve the accuracy of ET 
- All models showed little spatial variability of ET for winter season because ET values are low across CONUS
- Low temperatures and withered vegetation lead to poor results for remote sensing retrieval
- MODIS underestimated ET overall
- Correlation to benchmark dataset varies based on total annual ET
- Choice of benchmark dataset is important and determine reliability of the comparison result 
- Most models performed better at the annual and seasonal scale
- Selection of the drive dataset can impact accuracy of ET algorithm 
- Soil evaporation is an important part of ET and its accuracy directly affects the reliability of ET products
- PML and MTE were effective in arid regions due to their consideration of the constraints of precipitation and soil moisture on soil evaporation

**Additional Notes**

- Accurate estimates of ET is crucial for understanding hydrological and ecological processes (Allen et al, 2005; Trenberth et al, 2009), agricultural drought detection and mitigation, planning of water resources (Teuling et al, 2009), and predicting extreme weather events (Orth et al, 2018)
- In situ monitoring of ET includes a variety of methods (Oberg, 2006), like eddy covariance towers
- In situ provides point or local scale observations, but cannot provide data a regional or global scales (Rana et al, 2001; Wang et al, 2010)
- READ Runhoff et al 2013 about MODIS ET assessment
- READ Chirouze et al 2014 about four remote-sensing based energy balance models
- Regression relationships between ET and remote sensing parameters are not formulated on the basis of underlying physical mechanisms (Wang et al, 2007)
- Single layer (big leaf model) vs two-layer energy balance models 
- NDVI and LAI represent vegetation characteristics without water stress (Cleugh et al)

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3040.2010.02181.x

**Findings:**

- Stomatal conducdance is regulated by environmental factors like temperature
- Higher temperatures elevate VPD, increasing the evaporative demand and often leading to stomatal closure to conserve water
- At higher temperatures, increased transpiration rates can lead to reduced leaf water potential, triggering stomatal closure to prevent dehydration
- Stomata are regulated in order to prevent embolism formation, the observed transpiration is expected to remain lower than the calculated threshold transpiration. This is observed on most species

**Additional Notes:**

- Stomatal closure controls the decrease in xylem water potential and the formation of embolism (Tyree & Sperry 1989). Jones & Sutherland (1991)

- Arid ecosystems have diverse vegetation types and spatial heterogeneity, posing a challenge for ET estimation
- Remotely sensed data may fail to account for these vegetation variations
- Implementing vegetation type distictions reduces error in ET estimates
- It is important to classify vegetation due to vegetation-specific traits (root depth, canop structure, etc)
- Spatial and temporal trends closely follow vegetation growth patterns, improving understanding of water use dynamics in arid regions

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108940

**Findings:**

- Canopy transpiration decreased during extreme heat days
- C. deodara reaches the maximum transpiration in a high-temperature environment at about 10:00 h
- Increased temperatures can elevate transpiration rates but may also lead to partial stomatal closure if water availability is limited
- High VPD often reduces stomatal conductance to prevent excessive water loss, though this limits cooling efficiency
- Decreasing leaf water potential triggers stomatal closure to conserve water, reducing transpiration.
- Maintaining high stomatal conducance during heat waves can increase cooling but risks water depletion, especially under drought conditions
- Different tree species regulate stomatal conductance in different ways

**DOI:** 

**Findings:**

- Woody plants have potential to modify streamflow, runoff, and recharge
- Shifts in T/ET ration can be expected with presence of woody plants
- Larger shifts expected in semi-arid environments because increasing influence of bare ground and surface energy budgets is linked to woody plants

-- Leads to changes in streamflow
- Woody plant cover reduces near-ground solar radiation (Martens et al, 2000)

Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences, 127(2), p.e2021JG006617.*

**DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1029/2021JG006617

**Findings:**

- UAS results showed diurnal tree sap flow

- Indicates low transpiration at noon (closed stomata)
- Sap flow and transpiration peaked by 15:00
- Explains decline in canopy temperature dispite rising air temperature
- ECOSTRESS more variable than UAS likely because ECOSTRESS represents average community composition (different percentages of soil/canopy)
- High rates of evaporation (not transpiration) were driving increased latent heat flux in morning
- Peak sap flow occured 1 hour after peak latent heat flux

**Additional Notes:**
- ECOSTRESS LST data can be used to inform transpiration dynamics Xiao et al. (2021)

**DOI:** 10Ð1029/2004WR003068

**Findings:**

- Coupled water and energy cycles in semi-arid environments
- Midday available energy higher in grasslands than shrub lands because of differences in net ration (Rn) and soil heat flux (G)
- Middayevaporative fraction and daily ET correlated with surface soil moisture (0-5cm)
-- Poorly correlated with water content a greater depths or averaged throughout rooting zone
- Infiltration following precip events only wets top 10 cm of soil
- Surface soil is the primary reservoir for water storage and source of ET during monsoon season
- Direct evaporation is a large component of ET
- Predicting ET based on root zone averaged soil moisture not appropriate in semi-arid environments
- Variability of ET on short timescales is critical for the coupled cycling of water, energy, and carbon
- ET effects how land-atmosphere interactions influences weather and climate
- ET effects Processes like plant productivity, soil respiration, and biogeochemical cycling
- In wet environments ET increases linearly with root zone water content (effective saturation)
- Soil heat flux is 30% greater at shrublands than grasslands
-- More bare soil in shrublands, stronger temp gradient at surface
-- More outgoing longwave radiation and more albedo
- Peak evaporative fraction (EF) occurs after largest events
-- EF decreases to 0.1 within a weak as the soil dries out
- Midday EF is related to volumetric water content of the top 5 cm
-- Explains 80% + of day to day variation
-- More sensitive in shrublands
- ET is equal to rainfall at both sites
- Daily ET does not clearly increase with higher root zone moisture
- Surface soil layer is the primary source of water
- ET returns nearly all rainfall to atm in sever days
- Water content fluctuation is the fundamental constrain on soil moisture storage and ET in semi-arid grasslands and shrub lands during monsoon season

**Additional Notes:**
- ET is roughly equal to precip on timescales longer than seasonal (Sala et al, 1992; Philipes, 1994; Reynolds et al, 2000)
- ET effects the amount of precip partitioned into runoff and recharge (Philips, 1994; Laio et al, 2001)
- Meteorological and vegetation conditions control ET when soil moisture is not limited (Shuttleworth, 1991)
- More bare soil = more rapid evporation (Dugas et al, 1996)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-3-259-1999

**Findings:**

- Under fair weather conditions, the EF typically exhibits a concave-up shape throughout the day.
- During midday, around solar noon, EF appears relatively constant but is generally lower than the daytime mean value.
- A decrease in soil water availability leads to a reduction in EF, indicating that drier soils limit the proportion of energy partitioned into latent heat flux

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2008.07.004

**Findings:**
- This study introduces a method that partitions ET in E and T
- T/ET ratio was higher for grass dominated sites than for shrub dominated sites
- In areas with sparse vegetation cover, such as grasslands and shrublands, soil evaporation constitutes a significant portion of total ET due to the higher exposure of bare soil
- T/ET remain constanty during study period (limited time frame)

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.11.002

**Findings:**

- Precip and ET dominate water balance at every site
- Fore summer drought - cumulative evaporation usually exceeds precip and depletes soil moisture
- Summer monsoons - evaporation lags behind precip, increasing soil moisture
- Fall - evaporation declines as veg down-regulates and soil evaporation declines in response to decreasing soil moisture
- A savanna E nearly equals P in most years
- At shrubland E nearly equals P in driest years, and less than P in years with runoff
- At grasslands E less than P - R - SM
- Majority of evaporation occurs during daytime and when RN - G is high
- Evaporation underestimated by 17-27%

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-3032-8_5

**Findings:**

- Understanding evporation processes is important for effective water resource management and environmental assessment
- Model that establish a relationship between evaporation rates and meterological factors often lack precision needed for diverse hydrological applications
- Modeling evaporation is difficult due to the variability of environmental conditions and limited data
- When water is available ET is primarily contrlled by atmospheric demands (solar radiation, temp, wind speed, humidity)
- In water limited systems ET is constrained by the soil's ability to supply water to the surface and plants, so it is less impacted by atmospheric demands

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1119076

**Findings:**

- Study was conducted on gerbera 
- Long term heat stress effects hourly transpiration
- Significant decrease in transpiration between 12:00 and 16:00
- As heat stress continued, reduced transpiration was prolonged

**Additional Notes:**
- High temperature triggers water savings mechanisms in plants, which leads to partially closed stomata (Leuning, 1990; Damour et al., 2010; Medlyn et al., 2011)
- High temperatures suppress root activity, which limited root water uptake (Nagel et al., 2009; Luo et al., 2020)

 **DOI:**  https://doi.org/10.1029/2024WR037622

 **Findings:**

- The main challenge in ET science is reconciling spatial data with point data from various sources across heterogeneous areas
- Each of the three general approaches to ET science (in situ measurements, partitioning, remote sensing) has strengths and weaknesses
- Communication and translation across these disciplines are key to closing the gaps
- Eddy covariance towers valuable for measuring long term ET
- Insufficient spatial coverage is a limitation to in situ measurements
- Other challenges to in situ measurements include resource limitation, site accessibility, and complex terrain
- Energy balance closure is another issue for eddy covariance towers
- Satellite based remote sensing provides extensive and consistent global spatial coverage of ET
- Spatial resolution of input data affect the level of detail of gridded ET products



**Additional Notes:**

- Different approaches to adjusting energy balance closure leads to significant uncertainties in daily ET (Bambach et al, 2022)
- Lack of in situ data makes ground truthing RS data difficult (Farella et al, 2022)
- Validation of RS ET against in situ data is limited (Stoy et al, 2019)
- RS is effective at monitoring spatial variation in ET but not so great at monitoring short term variations due to revist periods (Fisher et al, 2020; Gentine et al, 2007)
