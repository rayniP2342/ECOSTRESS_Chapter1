### Wilcox et al., 2006

**Citation:** *Wilcox BP, Dowhower, S., Teague, R., Thurow, T. 2006. Long-term water balance in semiarid shrubland*

**DOI:** [Link to DOI or URL]

**Findings:**

- Little surface runoff is ever generated in shrublands, even during large storms
- Surface runoff approaches 30% of precipitation in mesquite lands
- ET in rangelands ranges from 0 to 5 mm/day during dry periods
- ET of mesquite ranges depending on water availability
-- Roots can extract water from over 120 cm
- Almost all water exits via ET - 99%
- Very little water runs off or percolates deeper than 1 m
- Little potential for increasing water supply by reducing shrub cover

**Citation:** *Cavanaugh, M., Kurc, S., Scott, R., 2011. Evapotranspiration partitioning in semiarid shrubland ecosystems: a two-site evaluation of soil moisture control on transpiration. In Ecohydrology.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1002/eco.157

**Findings:**

- Soil moisture at the surface fluctuates more than at deeper depths and peaked after precip events
- Monsoons increase moisture at deeper profile
- Increased ET rates follow precip events
- Lag of peak T after precip events occurs for creosote, acacia, and shrubs
-- Relationship between precip and T not clear
-- Lagged response coincides with moisture reaching deeper in soil profile
- Strongest correlation between ET and soil moisture at shallow depths (37.5 cm and 15 cm)
- Strongest correlation between evaporation and soil moisture at 2.4 cm depth
- Correlation of ET to shallow soil layers typical of semi-arid ecosystems
-- High evaporative demand, poor infiltration (Scott et al, 2000)
- Precip rarely percolates below 10 cm in the summer (in this region), roots below this depth are not wetted
- When plants dormant, E will dominate ET
- T response not seen until 3 weeks following start of summer rainfall
- Peak T rates rarely sustain more than a day (almost always in a water limited state)
- Years with more precip events later in summer have higher T/ET ratio
- Amount of bare space and percent cover will affect T/ET ratio
- Rapid evaporation of surface soil layers between small precip events
- More intense precip events are favorable because water percolates to rooting depths

**Additional Notes:**

- Near zero ET prior to summer rains (also Kurc and Small, 2004; Scott et al, 2006)



### Scott, 2010

**Citation:** *Scott RL. 2010. Using watershed water balance to evaluate the accuracy of eddy covariance evaporation measurements for three semi arid ecosystems. Agricultural and Forest Meteorology 150: 219–225.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.11.002

**Findings:**

- Precip and ET dominate water balance at every site
- Fore summer drought - cumulative evaporation usually exceeds precip and depletes soil moisture
- Summer monsoons - evaporation lags behind precip, increasing soil moisture
- Fall - evaporation declines as veg down-regulates and soil evaporation declines in response to decreasing soil moisture
- A savanna E nearly equals P in most years
- At shrubland E nearly equals P in driest years, and less than P in years with runoff
- At grasslands E less than P - R - SM
- Majority of evaporation occurs during daytime and when RN - G is high
- Evaporation underestimated by 17-27%

**Citation:** *Huxman TE, Wilcox BP, Breshears DD, Scott RL, Snyder KA,Small EE, Hultine K, Pockman WT, Jackson RB. 2005. Ecohydrological implications of woody plant encroachment. Ecology 86: 308–319*

**DOI:** 

**Findings:**

- Woody plants have potential to modify streamflow, runoff, and recharge
- Shifts in T/ET ration can be expected with presence of woody plants
- Larger shifts expected in semi-arid environments because increasing influence of bare ground and surface energy budgets is linked to woody plants
- Woody plant encroachment increases T (and thus greater ET)
-- Leads to changes in streamflow
- Woody plant cover reduces near-ground solar radiation (Martens et al, 2000)



### Kurc and Small, 2004

**Citation:** *Kurc SA, Small EE. 2004. Dynamics of evapotranspiration in semiarid grassland and shrubland ecosystems during the summer monsoon season, central New Mexico. Water Resources Research 40: W09305.*

**DOI:** DOI:10Ð1029/2004WR003068

**Findings:**

- Coupled water and energy cycles in semi-arid environments
- Midday available energy higher in grasslands than shrub lands because of differences in net ration (Rn) and soil heat flux (G)
- Middayevaporative fraction and daily ET correlated with surface soil moisture (0-5cm)
-- Poorly correlated with water content a greater depths or averaged throughout rooting zone
- Infiltration following precip events only wets top 10 cm of soil
- Surface soil is the primary reservoir for water storage and source of ET during monsoon season
- Direct evaporation is a large component of ET
- Predicting ET based on root zone averaged soil moisture not appropriate in semi-arid environments
- Variability of ET on short timescales is critical for the coupled cycling of water, energy, and carbon
- ET effects how land-atmosphere interactions influences weather and climate
- ET effects Processes like plant productivity, soil respiration, and biogeochemical cycling
- In wet environments ET increases linearly with root zone water content (effective saturation)
- Soil heat flux is 30% greater at shrublands than grasslands
-- More bare soil in shrublands, stronger temp gradient at surface
-- More outgoing longwave radiation and more albedo
- Peak evaporative fraction (EF) occurs after largest events
-- EF decreases to 0.1 within a weak as the soil dries out
- Midday EF is related to volumetric water content of the top 5 cm
-- Explains 80% + of day to day variation
-- More sensitive in shrublands
- ET is equal to rainfall at both sites
- Daily ET does not clearly increase with higher root zone moisture
- Surface soil layer is the primary source of water
- ET returns nearly all rainfall to atm in sever days
- Water content fluctuation is the fundamental constrain on soil moisture storage and ET in semi-arid grasslands and shrub lands during monsoon season

**Additional Notes:**
- ET is roughly equal to precip on timescales longer than seasonal (Sala et al, 1992; Philipes, 1994; Reynolds et al, 2000)
- ET effects the amount of precip partitioned into runoff and recharge (Philips, 1994; Laio et al, 2001)
- Meteorological and vegetation conditions control ET when soil moisture is not limited (Shuttleworth, 1991)
- More bare soil = more rapid evporation (Dugas et al, 1996)

**Citation:** *Brandes, D., & Wilcox, B. P. (2000). Evapotranspiration and soil moisture dynamics on a semiarid ponderosa pine hillslope 1. JAWRA Journal of the American Water Resources Association, 36(5), 965-974.*

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- ET accounts for 95% of water budget/precip
- Bimodal patterns with peaks occuring after spring snowmelt and late summer monsoons (periods that coincide with highs soil moisture)
- Radiative energy inputs are highest in June/July but soil moisture is low, thus ET is low
- Soil moisture is highest in early May but daytime transpiration is limited due to freezing nighttime temps
- ET peaks in late spring and late summer, and is lowest in June and July
- The A horizon soil moisture is highly responsive to monsoon events but is quickly reduced to due to ET
-- There is less response at deeper layers
-- Soil moisture is not transported fast enough to meet evaporative demand
- ET and soil moisture are essential to understanding the surface hydrology of systems dominated by ET
- The quantity of snowpack causes ET to vary
- Shallow soil moisture is an important control on ET
- ET is moisture limited
- No evidence of atmosphere controlled rates

Evapotranspiration comparisons between eddy covariance measurements and meteorological and remote‐sensing‐based models in disturbed ponderosa pine forests. Ecohydrology, 8(7), 1335-1350..*

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- ET is the largest outgoing flux of annual precip for forest
- Difficult to measure ET across large areas
- Annual ET:
-- 510 mm at control site
-- 464 mm at restoration site

  **Additional Notes:**

  - ET is 85% of precip in ponderosa forests (Dore et al, 2012)

**Citation:** *Shuttleworth, W. J. (1991), Evaporation models in hydrology, in Land Surface Evaporation, edited by T. J. Schmugge and J. Andre´, pp. 93 –120, Springer-Verlag, New York.*

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4612-3032-8_5

**Findings:**

- Understanding evporation processes is important for effective water resource management and environmental assessment
- Model that establish a relationship between evaporation rates and meterological factors often lack precision needed for diverse hydrological applications
- Modeling evaporation is difficult due to the variability of environmental conditions and limited data
- When water is available ET is primarily contrlled by atmospheric demands (solar radiation, temp, wind speed, humidity)
- In water limited systems ET is constrained by the soil's ability to supply water to the surface and plants, so it is less impacted by atmospheric demands

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1029/1999WR900210

**Findings:**

- Soil moisture is critical link between climactic and vegetation dynamics
- In semi-arid conditions, ET is limited by soil moisture most of the time
- When soil moisture is available ET is controlled by atmospheric demand
- Under dry condition, soil moisture limits ET rates
- ET exhibits significant variability based on seasonal precip patterns and spatial differences in vegeation cover and soil properties
- ET is integral to soil moisture balance equation
- Accurate modeling of ET is necessary for predicting vegetation dynamics and ecosystem responses to environmental changes
