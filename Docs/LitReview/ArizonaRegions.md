- Evenly spaced parallel mountain ranges and intervening desert basins

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2018.07.013

**Findings:**

- Basin and Range climate is arid to semi-arid
- Rainfall higher in mountain regions
- Hot summers, mild winters
- Basin floors and drier mountain slopes typically host communities of sparse to densely-packed grasses, succulents, forbs, and shrubs, with denser vegetation
- Deciduous and conifer forests occur on well-watered mountain ranges
- Irrigation on valley floors where water available
- Form part of lower Colorado River Basin
- Rainfall varies greately
- Climate at lower elevations is drier in southwest than southeast
- Mountains recieve higher precip than basin floors

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- Average precip is 3 in. in Yuma area to 30 in. high elevation areas
- Two precip regimes (intense summer monsoon and low intensity, long duration winter precip)
- Potential evaporation exceeds precip
- Basin and Range divided between Sonora Desert and Mexican Highlands
- Broad, gently sloping valleys separated by mountain ranges
- Mexican Highlands higher elevation than Sonora Desert
- Transition zone has undergone more deformation than Basin and Range
- Southwest, southeast, and northwest recieve less than 12 inches of precip annually
- Highlands recieve 16-32 inches of precip annually

**Citation:** *Schwinning, S., Belnap, J., Bowling, D. R., & Ehleringer, J. R. (2008). Sensitivity of the Colorado Plateau to Change: Climate, Ecosystems, and Society. Ecology and Society, 13(2).*

**DOI:** http://www.jstor.org/stable/26268003

**Findings:**

- Climate classified as semi-arid
- Total annual precip approx 250 mm (drier regions 130 mm)
- Summer precip in the form of monsoon
- Winter precip in the form of large frontal systems
- Vegetation aptterns follow climatic drivers
- Summer and winter precip highly variable from year to year (linked to ENSO cycle)
- Low evaporative demand during winter
- Subalpine regions = Engelmann spruce and subapline fir
- With decreasing elevation = mixed conifer, douglas fir, white fir, bue spruce, and ponderosa pine
- Between 2100 and 1600 m = pinyon/juniper woodlands
- Lower elevations = desert scrub, evergreen or winter-deciduous shrubs and perennial grassses, sagebrush,
- All plants respond to winter precip, but responses to summer precip vary
- Deep rooted species least responsive to summer rain
- Grasses and shrubs use most summer rain

**DOI:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/43daa7037ed91a3ac023a3bb9a6ada03aaf61e52

**Findings:**

- COPlat is semi-arid with sparse vegetation, low humidity and limited precipitation
- Higher elevations recieve more precip, especially in the form of winter snow

**DOI:** 

**Findings:**

- Elevation averages 1500-1800 m (mountains are higher)
- Average rainfall is < 200 mm
- Hot summers and extensive periods of frost in winter
- Vegetation below 1500 m = shurbland and grassland
- Vegetation about 1500 m = pinyon, juniper
- Vegetation above 2300 m = ponderosa pine
- Vegetation above 2700 m = mixed conifer, douglas fir, white fir, aspen, subapline fir, engelmann spruce
- As elevation increases, precip increases and PET decreases

**Findings:**

- distinct biogeographic, climate, and physiographic province
