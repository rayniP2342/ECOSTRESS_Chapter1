**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gexplo.2018.07.013

**Findings:**

- Basin and Range climate is arid to semi-arid
- Rainfall higher in mountain regions
- Hot summers, mild winters
- Basin floors and drier mountain slopes typically host communities of sparse to densely-packed grasses, succulents, forbs, and shrubs, with denser vegetation
- Deciduous and conifer forests occur on well-watered mountain ranges
- Irrigation on valley floors where water available
- Form part of lower Colorado River Basin
- Rainfall varies greately
- Climate at lower elevations is drier in southwest than southeast
- Mountains recieve higher precip than basin floors

**DOI:**

**Findings:**

- Average precip is 3 in. in Yuma area to 30 in. high elevation areas
- Two precip regimes (intense summer monsoon and low intensity, long duration winter precip)
- Potential evaporation exceeds precip
- Basin and Range divided between Sonora Desert and Mexican Highlands
- Broad, gently sloping valleys separated by mountain ranges
- Mexican Highlands higher elevation than Sonora Desert
- Transition zone has undergone more deformation than Basin and Range
- Southwest, southeast, and northwest recieve less than 12 inches of precip annually
- Highlands recieve 16-32 inches of precip annually
